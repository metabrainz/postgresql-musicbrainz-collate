PostgreSQL MusicBrainz Collate Extension
========================================

This extension provides collate support using the
[Unicode Collation Algorithm](http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/),
as it is implemented by the
[International Components for Unicode](http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation)
library.


Usage
-----

This module provides a simple function to generate a sortkey from a postgresql
TEXT column.

    test=> select * from unsorted order by musicbrainz_collate(column) limit 4;
     name
    ------
     AAA
     ÄÄÄ
     aaa
     äää

Note that older versions of ICU may give a different order:

     name
    ------
     aaa
     AAA
     äää
     ÄÄÄ

Warning: Collate always assumes that input is UTF-8 encoded. This function is
not very useful in databases with other encodings.

Warning: Indexes based on this function should be rebuilt after upgrading ICU.


Requirements
------------

To use this extension you will need:

- PostgreSQL version 8.3 or newer
- libicu version 3.8 or newer
- pkg-config

You will need -dev packages installed for libicu and PostgreSQL, check that
pg_config is in your path.


Installation
------------

To build and install this extension, simply run:

    % make
    % sudo make install

Then, to activate this extension in your database, run the SQL:

    CREATE EXTENSION musicbrainz_collate;

Databases using the old extension system can be upgraded with:

    CREATE EXTENSION musicbrainz_collate FROM unpackaged;

If you run into problems with building, see [PostgreSQL wiki for
troubleshooting](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Extension_build_troubleshooting)
